- Hi, I’m @shicell !
- I’m trying to get back into coding, and learn more about machine learning in order to apply it to language aquisition. 
  This is in hopes of bettering my communities rentention of their indigenous language. 
- I recently graduated from Meredith College with a degree in Mathematics. After a tough period during covid, I'm ready to challenge myself!
